// unordered_set

// Containers that store unique elements in no particular order
// which allow for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value

// Keys are immutable, the elements cannot be modified once in the container - they can be inserted and removed, though

// unordered_set containers are faster than set containers to access individual elements by their key,
// although they are generally less efficient for range iteration through a subset of their elements
