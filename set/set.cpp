// std::set


// An associative container that contains a sorted set of unique objects of type Key
// Sorting is done using the key comparison function Comare
// Search, removal, and insertion operations have logarithmic complexity
// Usually implemented as red-black trees

// The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type.
// Since iterator is convertible to const_iterator, const_iterator should be used in function parameter
// lists to aviod violations of the One Definition Rule
